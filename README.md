# Predicting Housing Prices in USA using Linear Regression
A real estate agent wants help in predicting housing prices in the USA. The agent has provided a dataset of housing prices, along with some features of the houses. The aim is to create a model that can be used to estimate the selling price of a house based on its features.

## Data
The dataset provided for this task is "USA_Housing.csv". It contains the following columns:

'Avg. Area Income': Average Income of residents of the city house is located in.
'Avg. Area House Age': Average Age of Houses in the same city.
'Avg. Area Number of Rooms': Average Number of Rooms for Houses in the same city.
'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms': Average Number of Bedrooms for Houses in the same city.
'Area Population': Population of the city where the house is located.
'Price': Price at which the house was sold.
'Address': Address for the house.

## Tasks
The following tasks will be performed in this project:

Importing the data and necessary libraries
Previewing and understanding the data
Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Building a linear regression model
Evaluating the model
Interpreting the results obtained from the model

## Model
The model we will be using for this task is Linear Regression. Linear Regression is a popular algorithm used in Machine Learning to predict continuous variables. It works by finding the best-fit line that can represent the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable.

We will use the features provided in the dataset to train the model and predict the housing prices. We will evaluate the model by calculating the mean squared error and the coefficient of determination (R-squared).

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project aims to create a model that can be used to predict housing prices in the USA. We will be using Linear Regression as our algorithm of choice. We will perform EDA, build a model, and evaluate the model to determine its performance. The results obtained from the model will be used to help the real estate agent in estimating the selling price of a house based on its features.
