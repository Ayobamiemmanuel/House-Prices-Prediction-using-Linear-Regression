# House-Prices-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression
A real estate agent wants some help predicting housing prices in USA. He has asked you to somehow create a model for him that allows him to put in a few features of a house and returns back an estimate of what the house would sell for.

You are going to use Linear Regression to solve this problem.

'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms': Avg Number of Bedrooms for Houses in same city
'Area Population': Population of city house is located in
'Price': Price that the house sold at
'Address': Address for the house
Your tasks are to:

Import the data
Preview and understand the data
Perform exploratory data analysis
Build a linear regression model
Evaluate your model
